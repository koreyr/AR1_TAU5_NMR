The sample was purified with an AKTA pure 25 FPLC. 
Size exclusion chromatography was carried out at room temperature using a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL to isolate monomeric species of our expressed peptide. 
A minimal buffer containing 0.1 M NaP, 10\% $D_2O$ in water by volume at a pH of 7.4. \textcolor{blue}{Much to be added and checked here. }
The resulting samples contained the necessary solvent environment, and EPI-001 and peptide concentration to perform NMR and CD measurements.
