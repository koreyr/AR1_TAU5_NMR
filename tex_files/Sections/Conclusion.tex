From the NMR chemical shifts and there perturbations insight into the physiochemical influence of EPI-001 on the Tau-5 domain of Human Androgen Receptor-1. The changes to the conformational sampling of the Tau-5 domain are assessed via the NMR chemical shift perturbations. From the CS perturbations we conclude that EPI-001 changes the helical propensity of two regions, R2 and R3. The helicity sampling is increased for R2, while it is deminished in R3, albiet the CS perturbations of R3 are less than those observed in R2. Thus EPI-001, influences helical propensity shifting sampling of helical content, deminishing structural organization.
